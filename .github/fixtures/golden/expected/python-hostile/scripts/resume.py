Nothing here is stored. Every pointer is read from the file that owns it --
the in-progress entry in docs/features.json (status, phase, next), its plan
file, and the git branch -- and the pointers are cross-checked. When they
disagree this REFUSES to print a brief: a resume built on contradictory
pointers resumes the wrong work confidently.
