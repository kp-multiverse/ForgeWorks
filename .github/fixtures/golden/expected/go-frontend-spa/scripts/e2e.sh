# The slow gate: end-to-end tests, kept OUT of the inner-loop quality gate so
# the TDD cycle stays fast. Runs in CI and pre-merge.
#
# Go e2e tests are guarded by the `e2e` build tag and live under tests/e2e/, so
# the fast `go test ./...` never sees them. For an API or CLI project this is the
# full request -> response -> persisted-state path; add a browser driver only if
# the project grows a UI surface.
#
# Stays green until the first e2e test is written: with the `e2e` tag and no test
# functions yet, `go test` simply reports no tests and exits 0.
