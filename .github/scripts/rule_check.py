"""Fail when a rule the template STATES and a gate that ENFORCES it disagree.

Every bug found in the v4.1 field review was the same shape: one fact written
down twice, drifting apart.

    AGENTS.md <context> said "20K"     while docs-budget said 20000 and the
                                       real file sat at 19,977
    <context> banned whole-file reads  while nothing offered a cheaper read
    the iteration skill said           while docs-budget capped
      "half a context window"            nothing at all
    dup_check.py's docstring cited     a block that does not exist
      <architecture-discipline>

None of those needed a real project to surface. They were checkable the whole
time, and nothing checked them. This is that check.

The rule it enforces is simple: **a gate owns its number; prose points at the
gate.** So the fix for a failure here is almost never "update the other copy" --
it is "delete the copy and name the gate instead."

    python3 .github/scripts/rule_check.py [rendered-tree ...]

With no arguments it renders every golden fixture and checks each tree.
