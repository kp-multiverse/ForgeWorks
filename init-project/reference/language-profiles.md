# Language profiles

The YAML blocks below are the human-readable profile reference (commands for
Phase 4.5, CI notes, conventions). The renderer consumes the machine-readable
copy at `templates/profiles/<lang>/profile.json` -- when you change a value
here, change it there too (CI cross-checks the load-bearing scalars).

### Python (fully supported)

```yaml

notes:
  type_annotations: |
    - Python 3.12+ syntax: `list[int]` not `List[int]`. `dict[str, X]` not `Dict[str, X]`.
    - Every function signature fully typed, including return types.
    - `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module.
  imports: |
    - Order: stdlib -> third-party -> local. Sorted by ruff (`I` rule set).
    - One module per import line for stdlib and third-party.
    - If a name is used ONLY in annotations, ruff's TC rules will move it under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` -- but a name a framework resolves at RUNTIME from the annotation (e.g. FastAPI's `Request`/`Response`/`UploadFile` in route signatures) must stay a real import. Keep those imports at runtime and mark them `# noqa: TC002` if flagged.
  async: |
    - Match the project shape: in a server or any concurrent context, I/O (HTTP, DB, LLM) should be `async`. In a CLI, script, batch job, or library with no concurrency, plain sync is simpler and fine -- do not add async for its own sake.
    - When you do go async, use `asyncio.TaskGroup` (Python 3.11+) for concurrent work, and keep the whole I/O path async (no sync calls blocking the loop).
  errors: |
    - Specific exception classes per domain. Never bare `Exception`.
    - Fail-closed on safety/security: if uncertain, refuse rather than proceed.
    - Framework dependency-injection defaults (e.g. FastAPI `Depends(...)`) are called markers, not values: never replace `Depends(get_settings)` with a bare `get_settings()` call at import time -- the first form resolves per-request, the second freezes one instance at import and 500s under test overrides.
  config: |
    - `pydantic-settings` for all configuration.
    - Never hardcode API keys, URLs, or model names. Pull from env or settings.
  logging: |
    - `logging` module, not `print`.
    - Structured log lines (JSON if going to ingest, key=value otherwise).
  test_layout: |
    - `tests/` mirrors `src/` structure. Unit + functional tests run in the fast gate.
    - `tests/e2e/` holds end-to-end tests marked `@pytest.mark.e2e`; they are excluded from the fast gate and run via `scripts/e2e.sh` in CI. For a UI use `pytest-playwright` (headless browser); for API-only assert the full request -> response -> persisted-state path.
    - Security/red-team tests are marked `@pytest.mark.security` and follow the `docs/SECURITY.md` checklist.
    - Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests. Inject fakes via fixtures/dependency objects; no mocks for code you own.
    - `factory-boy` or hand-rolled fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` for data.
    - `hypothesis` for property-based tests on pure functions.
    - `--import-mode=importlib` is set in addopts: test files may share basenames across folders without `__init__.py` shims.
  precommit_hooks: |
    This profile ships `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `ruff` (`--fix`) and `ruff-format`, plus the generic hooks (trailing-whitespace, yaml/toml/json validation, large-file guard). Install once with `uv run pre-commit install`. (TypeScript, Go, and Rust profiles ship no pre-commit; their `qa` gate + CI are the enforcement.)
```

### TypeScript (complete)

Files live in `templates/profiles/typescript/`. The gate is expressed as npm scripts in `package.json` (qa is verify-only; fix mutates; e2e is separate). Ships no pre-commit config.

```yaml
language_version: "Node 22 (LTS) / TypeScript 5.7+"
file_extension: "ts"
package_manager: "npm"
manifest_file: "package.json"

qa_command: "npm run qa"
fix_command: "npm run fix"
e2e_command: "npm run e2e"
e2e_browser_install: "npx playwright install --with-deps chromium"
test_runner: "vitest"

notes:
  type_annotations: |
    - `strict: true`. Annotate every exported function's params and return type; let inference handle locals. Prefer `unknown` over `any`; never `as any` or `// @ts-ignore`.
  imports: |
    - ES modules only (`"type": "module"`). `import`/`export`, never `require`. Use `import type { X }` for type-only imports.
  async: |
    - Server/concurrent context: I/O is `async`/`await`. CLI/library with no concurrency: plain sync is fine -- do not add async for its own sake. Never leave a floating promise.
  errors: |
    - Throw `Error` subclasses per domain; never throw strings. Fail closed on safety/security.
  config: |
    - Read `process.env` at one boundary; validate it (e.g. zod) into a typed config. Secrets in `.env` (gitignored), never hardcoded.
  logging: |
    - Structured logger (`pino`) or `console` with structured fields; no scattered `console.log` in committed code.
  test_layout: |
    - `tests/` mirrors `src/`; unit + functional (`*.test.ts`) run in the fast gate via `vitest run`. `tests/e2e/` holds Playwright specs, excluded from the fast gate, run via `npm run e2e`.
    - Inject fakes via params/factories; avoid mocking modules you own.
  precommit_hooks: |
    - Not used. The TypeScript profile ships no `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `npm run qa` (local + CI) is the gate.
```

### Go (complete)

Files live in `templates/profiles/go/`. The gate is `scripts/qa.sh` (verify-only: gofmt-check, vet, golangci-lint, test); fix mutates; e2e is build-tag gated (`//go:build e2e`). Ships no pre-commit config.

```yaml
language_version: "1.25+"
file_extension: "go"
package_manager: "go mod"
manifest_file: "go.mod"
install_command: "go mod download"

  - **testing package**: https://pkg.go.dev/testing
  - **golangci-lint**: https://golangci-lint.run/

notes:
  type_annotations: |
    - Statically typed; the compiler is the type checker (`go build ./...`). Explicit types on exported signatures; `:=` for obvious locals. Keep zero values meaningful.
  imports: |
    - Group stdlib / third-party / local, blank-line separated. `goimports` (fix.sh) sorts and prunes. Unused imports fail compilation.
  async: |
    - Concurrency is goroutines + channels, only where it earns its keep; CLI/script/library stays sequential. Use `context.Context` on I/O paths; never leak goroutines.
  errors: |
    - Return `error` last; check it immediately. Wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`; inspect with `errors.Is`/`As`. Reserve `panic` for unrecoverable state. Fail closed.
  config: |
    - Config from env (`os.Getenv`) or flags; never hardcode keys/URLs/models. Secrets out of source and `go.mod`.
  logging: |
    - `log/slog` (structured), not `fmt.Println`, for application logs.
  test_layout: |
    - `_test.go` files beside the code (`package app`) run in the fast gate via `go test ./...`. `tests/e2e/` is `//go:build e2e`-gated, excluded from the fast gate, run via `scripts/e2e.sh`.
    - Table-driven tests + `t.Run` subtests. Inject fakes via interfaces you own; avoid mocking frameworks.
  precommit_hooks: |
    - Not used. The Go profile ships no `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `bash scripts/qa.sh` (local + CI) is the gate.
```

### Rust (complete)

Files live in `templates/profiles/rust/`. The gate is `scripts/qa.sh` (verify-only: line cap, fmt-check, clippy with warnings-as-errors, check, test); fix mutates; e2e tests are `#[ignore]`-tagged in `tests/e2e.rs` and run via `scripts/e2e.sh`. The toolchain (compiler + clippy + rustfmt) is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`, which rustup honors everywhere (local, dev container, CI). The manifest ships as a plain `Cargo.toml` (no `.example` suffix needed: cargo never scans nested directories, so the template copy is inert -- unlike Python's `pyproject.toml`). Ships no pre-commit config.

```yaml
language_version: "1.96 (edition 2024; pinned by rust-toolchain.toml)"
file_extension: "rs"
package_manager: "cargo"
manifest_file: "Cargo.toml"
install_command: "cargo fetch"
add_dep_command: "cargo add"
qa_command: "bash scripts/qa.sh"
fix_command: "bash scripts/fix.sh"
e2e_command: "bash scripts/e2e.sh"
e2e_browser_install: ""   # Rust e2e is API/CLI-level by default (no browser)

notes:
  type_annotations: |
    - Statically typed; the compiler is the type checker (`cargo check`). Explicit types on public signatures; let inference handle locals. Prefer borrowed views (`&str`, `&[T]`) for parameters and owned types for returns.
  imports: |
    - `use` statements at the top, grouped stdlib / third-party / crate-local, blank-line separated (rustfmt keeps each group sorted). No wildcard imports outside preludes and test modules.
  async: |
    - Add async (tokio) only when the project is genuinely concurrent (server, many parallel I/O calls); a CLI, batch job, or library stays synchronous -- do not add an async runtime for its own sake. When async, keep the whole I/O path async and never block the executor (no `std::thread::sleep` or sync file I/O inside it).
  errors: |
    - Return `Result<T, E>` with a domain error enum (`thiserror` in libraries; `anyhow` acceptable at the application boundary). No `unwrap()`/`expect()` outside tests and provably-infallible spots; `?` for propagation; `panic!` only for unrecoverable invariants. Fail closed on safety/security.
  config: |
    - Read env at one boundary into a typed config struct; never hardcode keys/URLs/models. Secrets in `.env` (gitignored), never in source or Cargo.toml.
  logging: |
    - `tracing` (structured, with spans) for application logs -- not `println!`.
  test_layout: |
    - Unit tests live beside the code in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks; integration tests in `tests/`; both run in the fast gate via `cargo test`. `tests/e2e.rs` is `#[ignore]`-tagged, excluded from the fast gate, run via `scripts/e2e.sh` (`cargo test --test e2e -- --ignored`).
    - Table-style cases via loops over input/expected pairs; inject fakes via traits you own; avoid mocking frameworks.
  precommit_hooks: |
    - Not used. The Rust profile ships no `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `bash scripts/qa.sh` (local + CI) is the gate.
```

### Experimental languages (Other)

"Other" has **no profile** -- there is no profile folder to copy, so a generated project would be core-only with no working toolchain. Do not imply otherwise. Get explicit consent first:

> "Heads up: that language isn't a built profile yet. I can lay down the universal core (AGENTS.md, docs, security files, CI shape), but you'd have to build the toolchain yourself -- there's no validated manifest, lint/format/type setup, qa/fix scripts, or green scaffold -- so the first quality-gate run won't pass until you complete it. Proceed on that basis, switch to Python/TypeScript/Go/Rust, or have me add a profile for it properly first?"

If they proceed: `render.py` cannot run without a `profile.json`, so this is the ONE path where generation is manual -- copy `templates/core/` only, substitute the discovery placeholders from the answers file by hand, leave clearly-marked TODOs for the toolchain placeholders in `docs/language-standards.md` and `.github/workflows/qa.yml`, do NOT generate a manifest or scripts, and tell them the gate is not green until they finish the toolchain. The better path is to add a real profile under `templates/profiles/<lang>/` (see the repo `AGENTS.md` `<adding-a-language-profile>`) so the experience matches the complete profiles.
