# Agent roster and offload map

Which agentic coders drive this project, what each one actually gets, and
where work should be offloaded. Two files carry this:

- **`docs/agents.json`** -- the machine-readable roster (this doc's source of
  truth). It is a RUNTIME config: edit it directly, or run `/select-agents`
  (Claude Code) to re-probe what is installed and rewrite both files. Rules in
  `AGENTS.md` read the roster from the JSON, so a change applies immediately --
  no re-render, no re-bootstrap.
- **This file** -- the human-readable matrix below.

Offload roles (the `roles` array in the JSON):

- `orchestrator` -- drives the loop, dispatches work, holds the gates.
- `utility` -- cheap-tier mechanical work (git housekeeping, log mining, bulk
  renames, doc formatting, status summaries).
- `second_opinion` -- independent review of important changes.
- `heavy_batch` -- large batch work (broad audits, big migrations, long
  test-fix loops), especially when the primary agent nears session limits.

**Workload shifting:** there is no API for "how much quota is left." When the
primary agent's harness shows usage-limit warnings, or a task is heavy batch
work, dispatch it to an installed `heavy_batch` agent from the roster and keep
the primary agent as orchestrator/reviewer -- shifting progressively more work
over as limit pressure grows.
