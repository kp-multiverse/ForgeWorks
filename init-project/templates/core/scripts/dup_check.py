"""Fail when the same block of source appears in two or more files.

DRY has a rule in `AGENTS.md` `<commands>` + the `iteration` skill, but a rule nobody
measures is a suggestion. This is the measurement: every 6-line window of
every source file, normalized and hashed. A window found in two different files
is copied code, copied markup, or -- most often in an agent-built project -- the
same paragraph of justification restated in five docstrings.

Normalization strips what varies without changing the shape: comments, blank
lines, string literals, numbers, and runs of whitespace. So two functions that
differ only in their strings still count as duplicates, which is the point.

    python3 scripts/dup_check.py             # check, exit 1 on a finding
    python3 scripts/dup_check.py --list      # print every finding, exit 0
    python3 scripts/dup_check.py --baseline  # accept today's findings, once

Two escape hatches, and the difference matters:

`.dup-ignore` (path globs, `#` for comments) exempts a file wholesale -- use it
only for a directory whose repetition is inherent, like a test tree where a
repeated arrange block reads better than a shared helper.

`.dup-baseline` (written by `--baseline`) records the HASHES of the blocks that
were already duplicated when you adopted the gate. Those stop failing; anything
new fails, INCLUDING new duplication inside a file the baseline already covers.
Edit a baselined block and its hash changes, so touching old duplication asks
you to fix it. That is the ratchet: a path exemption is permanent, a baseline
entry decays. Prefer the baseline; the file should only ever shrink.
