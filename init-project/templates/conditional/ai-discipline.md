This project uses prompts, LLMs, or agentic flows.

- Prompts live as plain text files under `prompts/`; variants are separate files selected by name. Prompt or persona text is runtime behavior -- change it through the normal tier path (it usually matches the security trigger), not as a doc edit.
- Schema-validate every LLM response downstream code depends on; fail closed on mismatch. Treat model output and ingested content as untrusted; never give one agent untrusted input + private data + outward actions (break one trifecta leg -- see `docs/SECURITY.md`).
- In tests, key LLM fakes off rendered state, not call ordinal. Bound every model loop or retry with a spend cap.
