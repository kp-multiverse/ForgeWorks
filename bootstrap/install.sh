# install.sh - Bootstrap a new project from this template.
#
# Usage (pinned to a versioned release tag -- recommended):
#   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kp-multiverse/ForgeWorks/v4.0.0/bootstrap/install.sh)
#
# The template files this script fetches are pinned to one ref (default: the
# release tag below), so they do not change under you when `main` moves. (Runtime
# inputs -- skills@latest, the MCP package -- are not fully reproducible
# yet; see docs/ROADMAP.md.) Override the ref for development with REF=... or
# BRANCH=... (e.g. BRANCH=main to test the latest unreleased state).
#
# This script:
#   1. Validates the environment (curl, git, npx).
#   2. Drops the bootstrap AGENTS.md into the current directory.
#   3. Installs the init-project skill (SKILL.md + templates/) into
#      .claude/skills/init-project/ using `npx degit` (pinned version).
#   4. Prints next steps.
#
# The whole body runs inside main(), called on the last line, so a truncated
# download executes nothing.
#
# Language-specific prerequisites (uv, npm, go, cargo, etc.) are NOT
# checked here. /init-project asks you the language and verifies its
# package manager once the choice is made.

==> Upgrade kit installed.

Next steps:

  1. Commit or stash any work in progress, then open Claude Code:
       claude

  2. In Claude Code, run:
       /upgrade-project
     (or say: "upgrade this project to the new template")

The upgrade skill reconciles your project against the current template:
it copies new always-on files that are missing, grafts new AGENTS.md rule
blocks and subagent sections into your existing files WITHOUT overwriting your
content, applies the language tooling delta, and reports what still needs a
manual look. It is non-destructive and safe to run more than once.

# 3. Done.

==> Bootstrap kit installed.

Next steps:

  1. Open Claude Code in this directory:
       claude

  2. In Claude Code, run:
       /init-project
     (or just say: "bootstrap this project")

/init-project installs the supporting skills (tdd, grill-me, ... from
mattpocock/skills), interviews you about scope and stack, then generates the full
project for your chosen language (Python, TypeScript, Go, or Rust): AGENTS.md, a .mcp.json
with Context7, CI, a PR template, and a green-on-first-run scaffold. It checks the
language's package manager (uv / npm / go) after you pick.
